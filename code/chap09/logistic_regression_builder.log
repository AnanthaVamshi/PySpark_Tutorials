createLabeledPoint() email =  Hello Jeff, Thank you for your email. I do not have a discount code for the book. If you just need a copy for yourself, I can provide it to you free of charge (you just need to come to my office to get it). If you want multiple copies, then please let me know and then I will talk to my editor. Please let me know.

createLabeledPoint() email =  Hi - I will meet him on Wednesday. He is unprepared for our meetings so he sits and works by himself and isn't ready to work together. Giving him an extra day will hopefully allow him to be prepared then we can use our time together more efficiently. I am hoping he is able to finish 3 of the 5 credits with me by May 18th.

createLabeledPoint() email =  Hello Jeff, Thank you for your email. I do not have a discount code for the book. If you just need a copy for yourself, I can provide it to you free of charge (you just need to come to my office to get it). If you want multiple copies, then please let me know and then I will talk to my editor. Please let me know.
